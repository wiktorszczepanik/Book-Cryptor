I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford's, 
in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the 
following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given 
in number three, herewith:

The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, and 
thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. eighteen 
nineteen. The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty-one, and consisted of 
nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight 
of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange for silver to save 
transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand dollars.

The above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is 
roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered 
with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault, so 
that no difficulty will be had in finding it.
